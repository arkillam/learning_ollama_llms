I installed PostgresSQL v16 because v17 is not yet supported by pgvector

The batch file that runs the shell, runpsql.bat, gave me a warning when I can it about varying character encodings, so I added this to the batch file near the top to fix it:
    chcp 1252
(I had to run notepad as admin to edit it)

pgvector pre-built binaries for windows:
https://github.com/andreiramani/pgvector_pgsql_windows

to set up pgvector, I downloaded the ZIP file from the above URL, unzipped it, and copied the files over as the read me said

the readme then had two commands that I had to run, but they only worked when I added the missing semicolons:
    CREATE EXTENSION vector;
    SELECT extname,extrelocatable,extversion FROM pg_extension where extname='vector';

I used pgAdmin 4 (the gui) to create an account called db2admin will full access to use in the code below.

Shell Commands: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html
\db lists tablespaces
\dn lists schemas
\dp lists tables

adding a + to these gets more information returned

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

to make table spaces work, I had to do the following; when I missed the "connect" step midway, it looked like things were not working

    to create a tablespace:
    CREATE TABLESPACE andrew_tablespace LOCATION 'd:\Coding\postgres_andrew_tablespace';

    to create a database:
    CREATE DATABASE andrewdb TABLESPACE andrew_tablespace;

    connect to that database:
    \connect andrewdb;

    create schema in connected database
    create schema andrew;

then create a table in andrew schema

create table andrew.people (
    id serial primary key,
    name varchar(255) not null,
    email varchar(255)
);

to create a table with a vector, to validate that this works:
(the '3' makes this a 3D vector ... pretty damn small)

CREATE TABLE andrew.items (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  embedding vector(3)
);

drop table andrew.people
drop table andrew.items

here is a table to put embeddings in, with columns to hold the source (e.g. filename), content, and the embedding vector
(768 happens to be the number of dimensions I see coming out of embeddings from nomic-embed-text)

create table andrew.embeddings (
    id serial primary key,
    source text,
    content text,
    embedding vector(1536)
);

create table andrew.deepseek_embeddings (
    id serial primary key,
    source text,
    content text,
    embedding vector(1536)
);

create table andrew.nomic_embeddings (
    id serial primary key,
    source text,
    content text,
    embedding vector(768)
);

create table andrew.granite_embeddings1536 (
    id serial primary key,
    source text,
    content text,
    embedding vector(1536)
);

create table andrew.granite_embeddings1024 (
    id serial primary key,
    source text,
    content text,
    embedding vector(1024)
);

create table andrew.pdf_embeddings (
    id serial primary key,
    source text,
    content text,
    embedding vector(768)
);
