# Learning Ollama & LLMs

I am using Ollama to run LLMs on my personal computer, while learning about how to work with LLMs, prompts, agents etc.  Mostly, I am trying to build RAG applications as a learning vehicle.

I set up Postgres with pgvector to store embeggings, and am writing code using Python and Java.  The Python is in the main directory of this project, while the Java is in the Eclipse project sub-directory 'learning'.

I am sharing this in case anyone finds benefit in reading it as part of their own learning.

postgres_notes.txt covers Postgres setup.  I did that first.

python_notes.txt covers what I did with Python.  I used langchain and other Python libraries to make things work.  I probably did not use langchain the normal way.

For Java, I am focusing on using the Ollama REST API.  I have read it is identical to the OpenAI API, so hopefully this will be useful for real work.
